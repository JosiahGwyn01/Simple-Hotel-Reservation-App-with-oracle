# Simple-Hotel-Reservation-App-with-oracle
This is a Hotel reservation app that was created for a project in college. This was coded 

# Disclaimer
This App is simple enough to run on the latest versions of python and oracle, I did not do anything fancy
or the like for this app as we were constrained with our knowledge with coding at the time. This project
was a way for me to understand python a little deeper. 

This code might not work for some reason or another, just look at the source codes available and you can figure it out there.

There are a lot of things I added during the coding process that now as of writing this might have been unnecessary but you can change
things in your own discretion.
